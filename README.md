This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy where a ConcurrentModificationException occurs when modifying a list while iterating using the eachWithIndex method. The bug.groovy file contains the problematic code, while the bugSolution.groovy file presents a corrected version.  The issue arises from attempting to remove an element from a list while simultaneously iterating over it using eachWithIndex.  This violates the iterator's contract and leads to the exception. The solution demonstrates safe ways to handle list modification during iteration.
